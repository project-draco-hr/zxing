    "\n\n        Must be overridden in a specific subclass to return True if this\n        Node (a dependency) has changed since the last time it was used\n        to build the specified target.  prev_ni is this Node's state (for\n        example, its file timestamp, length, maybe content signature)\n        as of the last time the target was built.\n\n        Note that this method is called through the dependency, not the\n        target, because a dependency Node must be able to use its own\n        logic to decide if it changed.  For example, File Nodes need to\n        obey if we're configured to use timestamps, but Python Value Nodes\n        never use timestamps and always use the content.  If this method\n        were called through the target, then each Node's implementation\n        of this method would have to have more complicated logic to\n        handle all the different Node types on which it might depend.\n        "
