'SCons.Platform\n\nSCons platform selection.\n\nThis looks for modules that define a callable object that can modify a\nconstruction environment as appropriate for a given platform.\n\nNote that we take a more simplistic view of "platform" than Python does.\nWe\'re looking for a single string that determines a set of\ntool-independent variables with which to initialize a construction\nenvironment.  Consequently, we\'ll examine both sys.platform and os.name\n(and anything else that might come in to play) in order to return some\nspecification which is unique enough for our purposes.\n\nNote that because this subsysem just *selects* a callable that can\nmodify a construction environment, it\'s possible for people to define\ntheir own "platform specification" in an arbitrary callable function.\nNo one needs to use or tie in to this subsystem in order to roll\ntheir own platform definition.\n'
